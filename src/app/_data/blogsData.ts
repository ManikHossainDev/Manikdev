It provides the basic structure of the site, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. HTML uses a series of elements to describe the content on the web page, including headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML is essential for web development as it allows developers to build structured content that browsers can interpret and display. Understanding HTML is fundamental for anyone looking to enter the field of web development."
